Chat with your PDFs using a powerful RAG system built with Deepseek, LangChain, and Streamlit. Real-time answers powered by Deepseek-r1 and an intuitive UI

## Descripotion
I developed a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Deepseek, LangChain, and Streamlit. This solution enables interactive conversations with PDF documents, delivering precise answers to complex queries based on your local files. The process begins with setting up Ollama’s Deepseek-r1 LLM model, renowned for its advanced reasoning capabilities. I then integrate this model into a LangChain-powered RAG pipeline and build an intuitive Streamlit interface for real-time PDF querying
